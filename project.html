The motor is controlled using Arduino. It also contains servo motors which water at an angle to achieve irrigation perfectly.","date":"13 Oct 2016","published_at":"2021-08-03T18:18:26.742Z","created_at":"2021-08-03T18:18:26.894Z","updated_at":"2021-08-03T18:18:26.894Z","star":"Irrigation technique that uses moisture sensors and arduino to automatically water crops."},{"id":14,"name":" LASER PIANO","poster":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HbDOrhy83hERqhbTsMxFRhTKwJwRLnHZ/view?usp=sharing","description":" Laser Piano was a project in which we added technology in \nart of playing piano.It was operated through laser lights. It\n was completely a wireless project where the basic devices \nused were LASER LIGHTS, LDR SENSOR and some basic \nwires with a programmed arduino. Laser lights and LDR sensor \nwas placed opposite to each other. The circuit was designed in\n a way that till the time ldr is detecting light no current will flow\n and interrupting the path of laser with fingers lead to flow \ncurrent and musical sound was produced.
